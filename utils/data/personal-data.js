  description: "Hi, I’m Amnas — a software engineer who likes building things that feel simple and scale quietly. I work across Python/Django and Node/TypeScript on AWS, and I enjoy turning messy problems into clean, tested systems. Recently I’ve shipped a multi‑role job platform (Django + Next.js), a Solana product with Anchor/Rust, and Flutter apps that feel fast and polished. If you need someone who can own the backend, shape the API, tune infra, and deliver a smooth UI — I’m your person.",
